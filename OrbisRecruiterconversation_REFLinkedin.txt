I have a friend ( husband ShankarðŸ˜€)- more of an experts in web scraping and Data analysis and research ( has been the moderator for R forum in Indianapolis area and is ventured into the python web scraping world too)- says that the website is giving pop ups when he tried the â€˜ Seleniumâ€™ package - he said he shall tutor me on the web scraping part after he himself has achieved results !
As hovby
Technically he is a research scientist

Respected Sir,
Humble apologies for the abruptly ending email !
I am unable to complete the project as I had been taking care of the house . I need time to explore the various technologies that are available at my disposal for web scraping though I may eventually end up agreeing with my husband ( he chose selenium ) as he is usually tech savvy and smart about these things and web scraping is his hobby of sorts !
My kitchen has a serious-water damage situation and we have four big construction size air blowers running 24/7 by the repair people in our house .
I need a change of place to concentrate on any job that I may come across that needs my research work to be done .
I do admit that I have a kiddo and a bunny to take care of .

I shall get back to you with any progress I make - I did come up with a lot of visualization s- such as how does the commodities of an etf change over a course of ten years and what was the current news at that time ( tsunami, pandemic etc ).
I am yet unable to portray the same ,
Have a great day ,
Regards
Deepa
P.S any easier job , please do let me know

Respected Sir!
I have been very busy doing house work during the covid 19 quarantine and still am , other than taking cate of son , and hence could not sit and concentrate on the web project you gave me . However I am desperately searching for jobs , possibly in the Seattle area , and have upped my linked in resume by passing many skill sets . A few interviews have come by too ! Please would you be able to help me on that !
Thanks and regards
Deepa
P.S currently learning python as a programming language - it is quite different in its structure than the more traditional ones like c, Cplusplus and Java - yet to learn how to use selenium or even beautiful soup!
Thanks and regards
Deepa
